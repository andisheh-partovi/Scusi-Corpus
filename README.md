# Scusi-Corpus
A corpus of request-response pairs in a physical domain, along with some annotations.

The requests are made by people participated in a experiment about 12 objects labled in the images. They are then tagged by a human annotator and responsed to by another set of participants. The annotations, dialogue features, and responses are provided in the "annotations" CSV file. Please refer to the paper for more information about annotations and responses. 

All the audio files, manual transcripts, and automatic transcipts of the requests are provided in the "descriptions" zipped folder.

The corpus is available to use for free. We just ask that you kindly cite the paper.
